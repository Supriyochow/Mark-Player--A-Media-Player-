# Mark-Player--A-Media-Player- Using Python, Tkinter, Mutagen and PyGame
Mark Player is a media player built using Python. It can mainly perform most of the stuffs a media player generally is capable of. 
This player is made up with Python Frameworks namely Tkinter, Mutagen and PyGame

Tkinter is a Python Module for creating GUI applications. I have used Tkinter ttk, ttkthemes for using some themes, filedialog for handling files.

Here mutagen MP3 is been used for handling the audio metadata so that we can retrieve the audio files from the system. For that I also have used the os module.
