# Mark-Player--A-Media-Player- Using Python, Tkinter, Mutagen and PyGame
Mark Player is a media player built using Python. It can mainly perform most of the stuffs a media player generally is capable of. 
This player is made up with Python Frameworks namely Tkinter, Mutagen and PyGame

<strong>Tkinter</strong> is a Python Module for creating GUI applications. I have used Tkinter ttk, ttkthemes for using some themes, filedialog for handling files.

Here <strong>mutagen MP3</strong> is been used for handling the audio metadata so that we can retrieve the audio files from the system. For that I also have used the os module.

I have also used <strong>PyGame Mixer</strong> for handling the audio files. It is generally used for playing, rewinding, stopping etc. the audio files.

>This is the list of the things that the software is capable of doing:
1. Can select multiple songs and import it on the playlist of the Player
2. Has a play button to play them
3. User can use Next and Previous button to jump into next or previous songs
4. Has a song Slider, which moves with the time of the song
5. User can use the slider to move through the song
6. Mute and Unmute button is there, it can also control volume through the volume controller
7. Has Stop and Rewind buttons to stop and rewind the songs
8. If multiple songs are there in the playlist, it auto plays the next song after the playing song is finished
9. Has an interactive graphical user interface
10. Has a menu bar to get easy access to every thing
11. Is installable

Here in this repository you can find the code with comments. The executable file cannot be because of its huge size. 
I have used pyinstaller and NSIS (NullSoft Scriptable Install System) for making the executable file.
I hope you will enjoy it.
